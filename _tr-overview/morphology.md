# Morphology

In Turkish, morphology is crucial for syntactic analysis. 
It also interacts with [tokenization]() since syntactic units, 
"inflectional groups", can only be determined after morphological analysis and disambiguation.


## Lemmas

### Issues

- We need a standard way of assigning leammas to non-root IGs.

## POS tags


### Issues

- UD speicification
  (<http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/u/overview/morphology.html>)
  says that "UD POS tags 
  focus more on what the word is than on which construction it is used in".
  This seems to be slightly at odds with Turkish morphology, as the
  morphological form already will indicate different uses of a "stem"
  with different POS tags.
